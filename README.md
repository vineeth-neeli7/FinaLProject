**Project**:
  title: "**Full Stack Login & User Management Application**"
  description: >
    This project is a complete **Full Stack User Authentication and Management System** developed as part of my internship.
    It demonstrates my end-to-end skills in designing, developing, and integrating a real-world web application
    using **Spring Boot for backend** and **React.js for frontend**.

**Tech_Stack:**
  backend:
    - Java 17
    - Spring Boot 2.4.3
    - PostgreSQL
    - JPA / Hibernate
    - RESTful APIs
    - Swagger UI
    - Layered Architecture (Controller, Service, Repository)
  **Frontend:**
    - React.js (Class Components)
    - Axios
    - React Router
    - Bootstrap
    - Custom CSS

**Features:**
  - **User Registration and Login Functionality**
  - **Password Reset using Security Question**
  - **Role-Based Access for: Doctor, Patient, Librarian, Admin, LibraryStudent**
  - **Form Validation on both frontend and backend**
  - **Admin Operations: View, Update, Delete Users**
  - **Integrated Swagger for Backend API Testing**

**Folder_Structure:**
  root: "FinaLProject/"
  backend: "loginapp/"
  frontend: "LoginFrontEndApp/"

**How_to_Run:**
  backend:
    steps:
      - "Import **loginapp** folder in IntelliJ or Eclipse"
      - "Ensure PostgreSQL is installed and running on port 5432"
      - "Database name: **postgres**, username: **postgres**, password: **postgres**"
      - "Run **LoginappApplication.java**"
      - "Swagger UI available at: http://localhost:8081/swagger-ui.html"
  frontend:
    steps:
      - "Open terminal and navigate to **LoginFrontEndApp**"
      - "Run: **npm install**"
      - "Run: **npm run dev**"
      - "Frontend accessible at: http://localhost:5173"

**Learning_Outcomes:**
  - Understood **end-to-end application development**
  - Gained hands-on with **Spring Boot REST API development**
  - Implemented **form validation and error handling**
  - Managed **role-based user workflows**
  - Built a **modular and maintainable full-stack app**
  - Practiced **real-time frontend-backend integration**

**Note:**
  This application was designed and implemented during my internship to simulate a professional-level web application.
  It covers practical scenarios like data validation, routing, form handling, and role-specific logic.
